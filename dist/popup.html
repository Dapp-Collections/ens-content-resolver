<h3>ENS Content Resolver</h3>

<p>This extensions resolves any .eth address that has an IPFS hash registered as
  content hash and redirects your browser to the content.</p>

<p>Try it out by entering e.g. <a href="http://monkybrain.eth" target="_blank">monkybrain.eth</a> in your browser's address bar.</p>

<p>Currently only works with Infura and IPFS gateway. Support for local Ethereum
  and IPFS nodes will arrive in the next release.</p>
<p>You can find the repo for this project
  <a href="https://github.com/monkybrain/ens-content-resolver">here</a>.</p>

<p>Feedback of any kind would be much appreciated.</p>
