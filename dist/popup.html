<h3>ENS Content Resolver</h3>

<p>This extensions resolves ENS domains (.eth) to IPFS hashes and redirects
  your browser to the content.
</p>

<p>Try it out by entering e.g.
  <a href="http://monkybrain.eth" target="_blank">monkybrain.eth</a> in your
  browser's address bar.
</p>

<p>It first tries to serve the content through your local IPFS gateway (localhost:8080).
  If you don't have a node running locally, it will use the public gateway
  (gateway.ipfs.io) instead.
</p>

<p>Currently it only supports <a href="https://infura.io/" target="_blank">Infura</a>
  for connecting to the Ethereum network. Support for local Ethereum nodes will
  hopefully arrive soon. As will support for
  <a href="https://ethersphere.github.io/swarm-home/" target="_blank">Swarm</a>.
</p>

<p>If you like this project, please star it on
  <a href="https://github.com/monkybrain/ens-content-resolver" target="_blank">Github</a>.
  If you'd like to contribute, even better!
</p>

<p>Feedback of any kind would be much appreciated (<a href="mailto:philip.prophet@gmail.com">philip.prophet@gmail.com</a>)</p>

<p>P.S. If you need help storing IPFS hashes with your ENS domain, I have written a
  service for that called
  <a href="https://monkybrain.github.io/ipfs-to-ens/" target="_blank">ipfs-to-ens</a>.
