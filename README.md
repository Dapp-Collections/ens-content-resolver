# ENS Content Resolver

Chrome extension that resolves any `.eth` address that has an IPFS hash registered
as content and redirects your browser to the content.

Install it via [Chrome Web Store]() or build it from source by selecting `dist`
as package root folder.

Currently only works with Infura and IPFS gateway. Support for local Ethereum
  and IPFS nodes will arrive in the next release, as will support for Swarm.

Try it out by entering e.g. [monkybrain.eth](http://monkybrain.eth) in your browser's address bar (after you have installed the extension).
